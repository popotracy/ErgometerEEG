# ErgometerEEG project
MATLAB-based user interfaces for applying the ergometer to the experimental paradigms. The interface will be used to provide 1) visual feedback, 2) data acquisition via National Instrument 9205, and 3) sending and receiving the triggers for the purpose of synchronizing signal recording (EEG, EMG, voltage...etc.).

## Equipments
1. Ergometer
2. Computer with a serial port
3. NI 9205 (the default analog input is 23, "AO23")
4. Monitor (HDMI)
5. EEG (Brain Product)
6. Hight-density EMG 

*Optional: We use the Vicon system to record the torques and the trigger impulse. However, the trigger impulses are also recorded in EEG and EMG separately. 

## Visual stimulation 
Purpose of the experiment...
The ratio(percentage) of applied force to  MVC will be presented in the format of a rolling ball in a tunnel. The participant is requested to apply his/her force to ramp the ball up and maintain it at a certain threshold for 1 minute and then slide down the ball. During the experiment, the brain signal of the participant will be recorded by EEG and the "muscle?" will be recorded by EMG.
